The latest version while doing this tutorial was version 5.5, however, you can get the latest one from the official download page JMeter, if it is different in your case.

Copy the Link of the Zip file and paste it in front of wget command tool.

wget paste-link

For example:

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.5.zip
Download Jmeter on Ubuntu 22.04
5. Setup JMeter on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Now, extract the downloaded file and for convenience, you can change the name of the extracted folder.

ls
Check the downloaded zip file and replace the version of the file in the below-given commands:

unzip apache-jmeter-5.5.zip
Change the folder name:

mv apache-jmeter-5.5 jmeter
Move it to somewhere safe such as /opt directory

sudo mv jmeter /opt
6. Add Jmeter to the system path
To easily access the Jmeter commands line tools without switching to its directory again and again, simply add its folder to your system path

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/jmeter/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Now, we can start it using a command i.e:

jmeter
7. Create Desktop and Application Shortcut
Well, those who are regular users of Apache Jmeter, can create a Desktop as well as Application launcher shortcut to readily access this testing application.

Create a Desktop shortcut file

nano ~/Desktop/Jmeter.desktop
Paste the following lines:

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=Apache-Jmeter
Comment=Testing
Exec=/opt/jmeter/bin/./jmeter.sh
Icon=/opt/jmeter/docs/images/jmeter_square.png
Terminal=false
StartupNotify=false
Save the file by pressing Ctrl+O, hitting the Enter key, and then Ctrl+X to exit the file.

Change file permission:

chmod 4775 ~/Desktop/Jmeter.desktop
Allow launching of file:

You will have a Shortcut file on your Ubuntu Dekstop, simply right-click on the file and select the “Allow launching” option.

Allow launching testing stress load
8. Run Apache Jmeter
After creating the Jmeter, we can launch it directly using its Desktop shortcut. Just double-click that and you will have this Stress testing application on your system launched to start working.

Install latest version Jmeter on Ubuntu 22.04
Also, add the shortcut in your Application launcher:

sudo cp ~/Desktop/Jmeter.desktop /usr/share/applications/
Launch Jmeter
9. How to update

sudo rm /opt/jmeter
sudo rm /usr/share/applications/Jmeter.desktop ~/Desktop/Jmeter.desktop
